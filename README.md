#ng-token-auth
A module for token authentication. Allows for cross-site connection to a stand alone api. Presents a registration window and guides the user to send name and email to get an apikey by email. Submitting that apikey returns a token for that user  which gets stored in localStorage.

This is an exercise in modularizing javascript on the front-end using angular and on the back end using node, express and mongo.
